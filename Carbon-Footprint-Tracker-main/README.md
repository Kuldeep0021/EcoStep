# Carbon Footprint Tracker 🌱

This is a MERN stack project I built as part of a full-stack web development course from **CiperSchool**. The goal of the project is to help users track their carbon emissions from daily activities and become more environmentally conscious.

## 📘 About the Project

During the course, we were guided to build this project step-by-step. It focuses on calculating carbon footprint based on user input (like travel, electricity usage, etc.) and also includes features like goal setting and a personal dashboard.

It was a great hands-on way to understand how React connects with Express and MongoDB in a real-world application.
